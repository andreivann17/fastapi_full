"""Init package for FastAPI application.

This file is intentionally left blank. It simply marks the
``app`` directory as a Python package so modules within can be
imported using the ``app.`` namespace. Keeping an ``__init__.py``
helps with tooling and prevents subtle import issues when running
the project.
